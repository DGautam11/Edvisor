We have a demonstration forest of 1800 hectares in Evo campus, right beside the classrooms, where you can observe forest areas and enjoy nature. The aim is to spend less time inside indoors and more outside, in the demonstration forest. For example, a lecturer can give you a task in the classroom, and after you will go into the demonstration forest with other students to work on that task. Practical learning in the nature goes on throughout the year, but as seasons change the amount of time spent in the nature is modified. This means that in the winter when there is snow in the ground, you’ll spend less time outdoors",
