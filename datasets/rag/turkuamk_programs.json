A mechanical engineer in Sustainable Design Engineering knows how to find the real needs of people and organizations, designs products, machines and services in creative cooperation, and respects the natural world and future well-being by making sure that the designs have a sustainable basis.Sustainable Design Engineering may be the most important study field today, since it combines the three areas that together can make huge positive impacts towards a better world and future for people and the planet:Mechanical Engineering: Technologies form the basis of the modern world, and it is at the core of mechanical engineering to make things work as effectively as possible from the viewpoints of functionality to material usage and energy consumption. In the studies, it includes engineering mathematics, materials and production and structural mechanics, just to mention a few.Sustainable Development: Sustainability forms the background for everything – whatever we do, it must fit the sustainability frame, so that life can foster in this planet now and in the future. And believe it or not, it is not just recycling, but also understanding circular economics, material and product life-cycle analysis, social and cultural elements etc.Design Thinking: While engineering and technologies are the ways, i.e. HOW to make things work as well as possible, a design approach gives the purpose, the meaning, WHY we do things – what are the real needs and the most crucial problems to be solved from the perspectives of LIFE and in both, the big picture, and the human-size living. It means learning e.g., human-centered methods, creative ideation, and visualization, prototyping and concept design.In Turku UAS you study in modern learning environments with cutting-edge laboratories and workshops, and versatile spaces for independent and group working.
